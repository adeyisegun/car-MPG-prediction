# Investigating Factors Affecting Fuel Efficiency in Cars

![Car](car.jpg)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on investigating the relationship between various variables and miles per gallon (MPG) in a dataset consisting of a collection of cars. The goal is to gain insights into the factors that influence fuel efficiency and contribute to automotive design, fuel efficiency improvement strategies, and consumer decision-making.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis techniques are applied to analyze the dataset and understand the relationship between the variables and MPG. The distribution, correlation, and statistical characteristics of the variables are examined to identify key factors affecting fuel efficiency. Variables such as engine specifications, vehicle weight, transmission type, and fuel type are considered.

## Data Visualization and Statistical Analysis
Data visualization techniques are used to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between the variables and MPG. Statistical analysis, including regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and feature selection, is employed to identify significant variables influencing fuel efficiency.

## Predictive Modeling
Advanced statistical modeling techniques, such as linear regression, multiple regression, or machine learning algorithms, are utilized to develop a predictive model for estimating MPG based on the selected variables. Model performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques.

## Project Highlights
- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset
- Analyze the relationship between variables and MPG using statistical techniques
- Develop a predictive model for estimating MPG based on influential variables
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and cross-validation
- Contribute insights to the automotive industry and environmental sustainability

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates proficiency in data exploration, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling techniques to uncover the factors that influence fuel efficiency in cars. The findings provide valuable insights into the impact of various variables on MPG and contribute to advancing the understanding of fuel efficiency in the automotive industry.
